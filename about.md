> ### Hi! I am Wilson Chua. Welcome to my blog!

I'm a GIS enthusiast from Singapore. I use QGIS and other open-source GIS software to make maps.  
Currently reading Computing at uni, so I am quite inactive at the moment.
This blog was migrated from Wordpress.com so that I might have more control over the front-end code. You can read more about my migration [here](/jekyll-migration).

In my free time, I enjoy prog house and liquid drum and bass. I also like running, because I'm bad at sports.

Feel free to contact me at [ &#119;&#105;&#108;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#099;&#119;&#099;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;](mailto:&#119;&#105;&#108;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#099;&#119;&#099;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;) if you have any questions about me or the contents of this blog.
