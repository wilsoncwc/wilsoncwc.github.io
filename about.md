## Hi! I am Wilson Chua. Welcome to my blog!

I'm a GIS enthusiast from Singapore. I use QGIS and other open-source GIS software to make maps.  
Occasionally, I dabble around with coding and websites. This blog was migrated from Wordpress.com so that I might have more control over the HTML and CSS.

In my free time I browse Reddit, and rave to progressive house and liquid drum and bass.  
I also enjoy running, because I'm bad at sports.

Feel free to contact me at wilsoncwc@gmail.com if you have any questions about me or the contents of this blog.
