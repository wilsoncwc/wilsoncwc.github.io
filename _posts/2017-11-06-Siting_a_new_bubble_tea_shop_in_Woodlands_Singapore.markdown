Lab Assignment #2 for my high school GIS course

## Introduction

A client requests an identification of a feasible location for his start-up beverage outlet in northern Singapore. The outlet specializes in bubble tea, and it was preferred that the location would take advantage of larger human traffic near major transportation routes.

## Summary of Considerations

Woodlands was chosen primarily due to the high commuter traffic across the Causeway between Singapore and Malaysia. The resident population would also play a large factor in locational attractiveness, specifically the younger age groups of 10 to 25 years. Important nodes to consider therefore include schools and malls which are heavily frequented by the above, as well as transportation hubs such as MRT stations, major expressways and roads. Also the locations of other bubble tea franchises should be avoided in order to minimize competition.

## Spatial Analysis

The featured map and the map below depict the major nodes of human traffic.

The following maps show the population data of the Woodlands planning area, delimited by subzone. The first describe the general population density, and the second the population density of the target age group (10 to 25 years).

## Conclusion

Bearing in mind the client’s preference to tap on major transportation nodes, Admiralty MRT was chosen to be the most feasible location for the start-up, which can be seen in the above map. The subzone of Woodlands East has an overwhelming large local population, and it may be possible that the traffic from schools and the residences may be comparable to that of the regional centre and Marsiling MRT. It is recommended that a café-style setup should be chosen in order to cater for a differing ambience to the only other competitor in the area, Gong Cha.
